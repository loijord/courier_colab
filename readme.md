This is a development site of Bolt/Wolt courier toolkits written in Python.

For production use, go to [https://loijord.github.io/courier_colab/](https://loijord.github.io/courier_colab/)

It's written in Python using Pycharm and Jupyter Notebooks. Scripts are really nice and in a process still, I'll `git push` them together with docs after they get more friendly :)
